# Dummy Restaurant Website

## Project_01

### Overview

This is my first attempt at creating a functional website. 

A couple of notes: 

-I am aware that the reservation form would not work properly in a real-world scenario, as there would need to be a way to inform the user of unavailable time slots. I simply wanted practice creating and styling an HTML form element, and a reservation form made sense for a restaurant website. 

-I am by no means experienced in design, and thus challenged myself to design an aesthetically pleasing web page. Any advice on design choices would be appreciated. 

Future Improvements:

-Implement an image carousel.

-Create a more realistic form. That is, write a program that will store reservation times that have already been booked and relay this information to the user while barring them from selecting an already-booked time.

### User Stories
-As a restaurant client

-I want to find information on a restaurant

-So that I can plan a visit to said restaurant
